Using the following analogy:
The scrum was set 29 times over the weekend in the Kenya Cup final
That is a scrum every 2 minutes and 45 seconds on average
Had there only been scrums, i would not be worried.
Then come the 21 lineouts that were set
Our final had 50 set-pieces.
The ball stopped every 96 seconds.
